# Skill & Agent Wallet Assessment Report

## Executive Summary

**Quality**: GOOD-to-EXCELLENT across both skill-creation infrastructure and custom agents. The ecosystem is mature and follows mid-2026 conventions reasonably well.

**Readiness for Skill-Based Workflow**: 85% — Infrastructure is solid, but custom agents lack formalized orchestration patterns and some skills need tighter specifications.

**Recommendations**:

1. Formalize a "skill contract" for MAGPIE_Server domain-specific skills
2. Strengthen agent-orchestration patterns (currently loose/informal)
3. Create a project-local skill that handles MAGPIE_Server-specific preconditions (guards, validation, state checks)

## PART 1: SKILL-CREATION SKILLS ASSESSMENT

### 1.1 skill-creator (.claude/skills/skill-creator/)

**Status**: ✅ VALID & PRODUCTION-READY

**Assessment**:

- **Frontmatter Structure**: Correct. Uses mandatory YAML block with `name` and `description` fields.
- **Workflow Quality**: Well-sequenced (Gather → Directory → Generate → Handle Advanced → Confirm).
- **Tool Integration**: Understands discovery, folder structure, SKILL.md generation.
- **Limitations**:  - Does not enforce naming conventions strictly (kebab-case is recommended but not validated programmatically).
  - No built-in validation for description quality (susceptible to vague descriptions that won't trigger discovery).

**Mid-2026 Alignment**: ✅ Matches the 2026 standard. Correctly identifies YAML frontmatter as critical for discovery, balances local vs. dynamic content.

**Verdict**: Use this skill as-is for general-purpose skill creation. It's reliable.

---

### 1.2 microsoft-skill-creator (.copilot/skills/microsoft-skill-creator/)

**Status**: ✅ EXCELLENT

**Assessment**:

- **Approach**: Hybrid (local + dynamic) knowledge model. Stores essential facts locally, uses Learn MCP for exhaustive reference.
- **Specificity**: Highly specialized for Microsoft tech stack (Azure, .NET, M365, etc.). Not applicable to MAGPIE_Server.
- **Maturity**: Advanced. Includes:
  - Three-phase investigation (Scope Discovery → Core Content → Depth)
  - Investigation checklist with explicit verification points
  - Clear local vs. dynamic content guidelines
  - CLI fallback (mslearn) when MCP unavailable
  - Content type matrix (what to store locally vs. what to keep dynamic)

**Mid-2026 Alignment**: ✅ Exemplary. This skill is a reference implementation for domain-specific skill creation.

**Verdict**: Don't use directly (Microsoft-only), but study its structure for creating MAGPIE_Server-specific skills.

---

### 1.3 agent-customization (.vscode/assets/prompts/skills/)

**Status**: ✅ VALID but WORKFLOW-FOCUSED (not a direct skill creator)

**Assessment**:

- **Purpose**: Disambiguator — helps choose WHICH primitive (instruction, skill, agent, prompt, hook) to create.
- **Decision Flow**: Clear decision table (instructions vs. skills, skills vs. prompts, etc.).
- **Location Guidance**: Comprehensive path mapping for each primitive type.
- **Validation**: Includes frontmatter syntax checks and common pitfalls (unescaped colons, tab/space issues).

**Mid-2026 Alignment**: ✅ Matches conventions. Correctly identifies `applyTo: "**"` as context-burning and warns against it.

**Verdict**: Use as a pre-flight checklist BEFORE creating skills/agents. Prevents wrong-primitive mistakes.

---

## PART 2: CUSTOM AGENTS ASSESSMENT

### 2.1 Librarian Agents (librarian.agent.md + librarian-claude.agent.md)

**Status**: ✅ VALID & SPECIALIZED

**Assessment**:

- **Scope**: Wiki/knowledge-base curation. Operates on `projects/HASTRAL/03_MEMORY/`.
- **Specialization**: Imports `/wiki-injector` skill. Understands Library protocol.
- **Tool Set**: Broad (file system, terminal, memory tools, semantic search). Appropriate for knowledge synthesis.
- **Operational Clarity**: Clear guidelines (wiki maintenance, ingestion process, tooling preferences, definition of done).

**Strengths**:

- Well-defined domain boundary
- Explicit tooling preferences (semantic_search, list_dir, insert_edit_into_file)
- Clear "definition of done" checklist

**Weaknesses**:

- Assumes perfect execution of `/wiki-injector` skill (no error recovery pattern)
- No precondition-checking pattern (doesn't verify wiki structure before ingestion)

**Mid-2026 Alignment**: ✅ Acceptable. Domain-specific agents should declare scope, tool preferences, and DoD checklists. This does all three.

**Verdict**: Solid reference. Add precondition checks before use in production.

---

### 2.2 Gamedev Agents (5 files: programmer, writer, engineer, artist, manager)

**Status**: ✅ VALID but LOOSE ORCHESTRATION

**Assessment**:

**Structural Quality**:

- Each agent is specialized (programmer handles code, writer handles narrative, etc.)
- All import a shared foundation: `gamedev-base.md` (good practice)
- Manager agent acts as orchestrator/router (good pattern)

**Foundation Quality (gamedev-base.md)**:

- ✅ Clear project goal (Shelder Evolution)
- ✅ Technical constraints (vanilla JS, NW.js/Node.js, RPG Maker MZ)
- ✅ Team philosophy (critical thinking, honesty, contextualized delivery)
- ✅ Explicit "no external tools" rule

**Weaknesses**:

- **No tool restrictions in agent frontmatter** — agents don't declare which tools they're allowed to use
- **No error recovery patterns** — what happens if an agent fails?
- **No precondition checks** — agents don't verify codebase state before acting
- **Manager is loose** — "coordinate and route" is vague; no explicit routing rules
- **No state management** — agents don't track what's been completed across turns

**Mid-2026 Alignment**: ⚠️ PARTIAL. The philosophy is sound, but the **orchestration layer is missing**. A mid-2026 agentic team should have:

- Explicit tool allowlists per agent
- State tracking (what's been done, what's pending)
- Precondition validation (is the codebase in a valid state to act?)
- Error recovery patterns (what to do when an agent fails?)

**Verdict**: Gamedev agents work for ONE agent at a time, but will struggle if deployed as a parallel multi-agent team. They need formal orchestration patterns.

---

## PART 3: GOVERNANCE & SAFETY SKILLS

### 3.1 agent-governance (.copilot/skills/agent-governance/)

**Status**: ✅ EXCELLENT REFERENCE

**Assessment**:

- **Maturity**: Advanced. Covers:
  - Policy-based access control
  - Intent classification
  - Trust scoring
  - Audit trails
  - Policy composition (most-restrictive-wins)

- **Code Quality**: Provides working Python examples with dataclasses and composition logic.
- **Framework Agnostic**: References PydanticAI, CrewAI, OpenAI Agents, LangChain, AutoGen.

**Mid-2026 Alignment**: ✅ Exemplary. This is how safety should look in 2026.

**Verdict**: Study this when designing MAGPIE_Server orchestration layer.

## PART 5: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MAGPIE_SERVER SKILL-BASED WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (This Session)

1. **Create a "MAGPIE_Server Preconditions" skill**
   - Validates state before any task (database integrity, file structure, git status)
   - Uses the `skill-creator` to scaffold
   - Stores in `.github/skills/magpie-preconditions/`

2. **Create a "MAGPIE_Server Orchestrator" agent**
   - Imports `magpie-preconditions` skill
   - Routes tasks to specialized agents (e.g., "auth refactor" → SWE agent, "security review" → audit agent)
   - Tracks state across turns (TODO → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED)
   - Enforces tool allowlists (refuse shell commands except via scripts)

3. **Codify the handoff protocol**
   - Document preconditions explicitly
   - Each skill/agent must state: "I will NOT execute unless [condition]"
   - Make guards **visible** in every turn

### Phase 2: Medium-term (Next 2-3 sessions)

1. **Create domain-specific skills**:
   - magpie-socket-operations (Socket.io patterns, handshake validation)
   - magpie-crypto-operations (password hashing, timing-safe verification)
   - magpie-database-operations (transaction patterns, schema validation)
   - magpie-auth-flow (JWT, role checks, session management)

2. **Formalize orchestration**:
   - Adopt governance-policy pattern from `agent-governance` skill
   - Define allowlist of tools per skill
   - Implement audit logging (every skill execution logged with preconditions checked/passed)

3. **Add error recovery**:
   - Document what happens when a skill fails
   - Implement rollback patterns for database changes

### Phase 3: Long-term (Agentic App Planning)

Document these patterns as a **Protocol Shim** that any future agentic app can consume. This becomes the foundation for the "real" agentic app later.

## PART 6: IMMEDIATE GAPS TO FILL

### For STEP-1.2 (Handoff vs. Codebase Comparison)

**What you need**: A skill that reads the handoff document, compares it against codebase state, and produces a delta report.

**Does it exist?** Partially:

- `gsd-codebase-mapper` can analyze codebase
- `create-specification` can generate specs
- But **no single skill does "compare plan vs. reality"**

**Recommendation**: Create `magpie-compare-spec-vs-codebase` skill that:

1. Reads the handoff plan (sequential list of intended tasks)
2. Reads the blueprint (codebase reality)
3. Produces a comparison matrix: PLANNED vs. IMPLEMENTED vs. MISSING vs. EXTRA

This is your first domain-specific skill.

---

## CONCLUSION

**Your skill/agent wallet is 85% ready for a skill-based workflow.** The infrastructure is solid, governance patterns are mature, and custom agents exist.

The missing piece is **formal orchestration + domain-specific skills for MAGPIE_Server.**

**Next step**: Create the `magpie-preconditions` and `magpie-compare-spec-vs-codebase` skills. Then proceed with STEP-1.2 using those skills as your foundation.
